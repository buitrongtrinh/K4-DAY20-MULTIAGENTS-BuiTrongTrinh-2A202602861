name: verify-before-finish
description: Use when a task requires producing output files or artifacts that a grader will inspect, to ensure the required deliverables actually exist and pass their checks before declaring done.
---
1. Before finishing, list every artifact the task requires (output files, JSON keys, headings, test files) and confirm each one exists on disk.
2. Run the project's own test suite (e.g. `pytest`) and read the actual pass/fail summary; do not assume success from partial output.
3. If a required output file is missing, that is a hard failure — create it and re-verify.
4. Re-read the task's stated conventions (file paths, header order, key names, formats) and check your artifact against each one literally.
5. Do not stop after a tool call that only shows a fragment of output; run a command that prints the full result you need.
6. Self-check: (a) every required file exists, (b) the test suite passes, (c) each stated convention is satisfied by the artifact, (d) no command was left mid-inspection.
